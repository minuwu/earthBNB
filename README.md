## Technologies Used & Their Purpose

- **Node.js & Express.js**  
  The backend is built using Node.js with the Express.js framework, enabling efficient handling of HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and server-side logic.

- **MongoDB & Mongoose**  
  MongoDB is used as the NoSQL database, with Mongoose providing an elegant object modeling and schema validation layer for interacting with MongoDB.

- **EJS & EJS-Mate**  
  EJS is used as the templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages. EJS-Mate adds layout and partial support for EJS templates.

- **Passport.js & Passport-Local**  
  Implements user authentication with session management, supporting local username/password login.

- **Passport-Local-Mongoose**  
  Simplifies integration of Mongoose with Passport for user authentication.

- **Session Management**  
  Uses `express-session` and `connect-mongo` to store session data in MongoDB, ensuring persistent sessions across server restarts.

- **Cloudinary & Multer-Storage-Cloudinary**  
  Handles image uploads and storage in the cloud, allowing users to upload images for listings.

- **Joi**  
  Provides schema-based validation for incoming request data, ensuring data integrity.

- **Method-Override**  
  Allows HTTP verbs such as PUT and DELETE to be used in places where the client doesnâ€™t support it.

- **Connect-Flash**  
  Enables flash messages for user feedback (e.g., success or error notifications).

- **dotenv**  
  Loads environment variables from a `.env` file for secure configuration management.

- **Mapbox SDK**  
  (Referenced in dependencies) Likely used for geolocation or map features in listings.

### Backend Web Application Development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

- Developed a full-stack web application using Node.js and Express.js, implementing RESTful APIs and server-side rendering with EJS.
- Designed and managed data models with MongoDB and Mongoose, including schema validation and relationship management.
- Integrated user authentication and authorization using Passport.js, Passport-Local, and session management with express-session and connect-mongo.
- Implemented secure file uploads and cloud storage for images using Cloudinary and Multer-Storage-Cloudinary.
- Utilized Joi for robust server-side data validation and error handling.
- Enhanced user experience with flash messaging (`connect-flash`) and dynamic HTTP method support (`method-override`).
- Managed environment variables securely with dotenv for configuration across development and production environments.
- Collaborated on features involving geolocation and mapping using the Mapbox SDK. -->
